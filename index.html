            Academically, RVK follows CCE(Continuous Cumulative Evaluation) pattern of education. Kids have no exams til 5th, but they wil be evaluaed on a day-to-day basis. there wil be dictations, tests every day,but neither i nor my son felt the strain of getting prepared for everyday tests;  reading & writting works are given on alternative days.
            
            There wil be a session on CCE in the first PTA. As we are used to the traditional method of learning,as a parent u might feel a little disconnected in the learning process of the child. but gradually it settels.</p>

<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">A school canteen is defined as one that: sells food and drink items to school students through an arrangement with the school on a regular and recurrent basis .It is a convenient way to deliver a range of healthy and nutritious food and drink options for your workforce, providing a separate space where they can get away from working areas and relax, eat and take a break in comfortable, safe surroundings without having to leave site.School canteens and other school food services are important educational resources. They have an important role in the provision of food to students and the school community as well as being an integral part of the school environment.Talk with your child about healthy canteen foods and drinks. Healthy canteen options include multigrain sandwiches, soups, pasta, curries, fruit salads and yoghurt. Unhealthy options include deep-fried foods, pastries, cakes, lollies, chips and sugary drinks.The canteen has the very important job providing healthy food and drink for students. This reinforces the nutrition messages being taught at school, shows that healthy foods can be delicious and exciting, and sets the foundation for healthy eating habits for life.</p>
